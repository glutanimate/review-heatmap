Adds a **heatmap graph** to Anki's main window which visualizes past and future card review activity, similar to the contribution view on GitHub. Information on the **current streak** is displayed alongside the heatmap. Clicking on an item shows the cards reviewed or due on that day.

**COMPATIBILITY**

This add-on is designed to work both on Anki 2.0 and Anki 2.1. However, as Anki 2.1 is still being tested it is possible that a future beta release will break 2.1 compatibility. **Please do not report issues with Anki 2.1 in the review section below**. Instead, please report all issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/hierarchical-tags/issues).
